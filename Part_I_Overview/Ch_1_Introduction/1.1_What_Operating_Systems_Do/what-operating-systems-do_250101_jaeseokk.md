### A computer system can be divided roughly into four components
 - Hardware
    
    > provides the basic computing resources for the system

 - Application programs

    > define the ways in which these resources are used to solve user's computing problems
 - **Operating system**
  
    > controls the hardware and coordinates its use among the various application programs for the various user
 - User
  
### User View
The user's view of the computer varies according to the interface being used.

Laptop or PC consisting of a monitor, keyboard, and mouse is designed for one user to monopolize its resources. The goal is to maximize the work that the user is performing.
